    <h2>International Background</h2>
    <p>I am a Mechanical Engineer (B.E.) with a career built in high-pressure, high-compliance industrial sectors. My experience includes working with <strong>Saudi Aramco (Saudi Arabia)</strong> and <strong>Shell Pearl GTL (Qatar)</strong>.</p>
    <p>In the world of industrial safety and engineering, precision is everything. I have brought this <strong>"Zero-Error"</strong> mindset to the world of SEO, where I help businesses achieve growth through technical accuracy and data automation.</p>
