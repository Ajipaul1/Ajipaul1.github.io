    Case Study: Building Organic Visibility for a Local Appliance Repair Business
  </h1>

  <p style="max-width:820px;">
    This case study explains how a Canadian appliance repair business
    reduced dependency on paid advertising and strengthened organic visibility
    through a structured website and SEO audit.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- CLIENT OVERVIEW -->
<section>
  <h2>The Business</h2>
  <p>
    The client is a local appliance repair company serving residential customers.
    Their technicians were experienced and trusted offline,
    but online visibility relied almost entirely on paid Google Ads.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- PROBLEM -->
<section>
  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  <p>
    Although the business had strong service quality,
    their website did not clearly communicate services to search engines.
  </p>

  <p>
    Competitors with weaker service quality were ranking higher simply because
    their websites were structured better for search.
  </p>

  <div style="margin-top:32px;">
    <img src="competitors.png" alt="Competitor visibility comparison" style="width:100%; border-radius:12px;">
    <p style="font-size:0.9rem; opacity:0.7; margin-top:8px;">
      Comparison showing competitors ranking above despite similar services.
    </p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- AUDIT -->
<section>
  <h2>The Audit</h2>
  <p>
    We performed a full website and SEO audit to understand
    what was blocking organic visibility.
  </p>

  <p>
    The audit focused on structure, clarity, and technical fundamentals —
    not shortcuts or trends.
  </p>

  <div style="margin-top:32px;">
    <img src="audit-1.png" alt="Website audit snapshot" style="width:100%; border-radius:12px;">
    <p style="font-size:0.9rem; opacity:0.7; margin-top:8px;">
      Audit snapshot highlighting structural and technical SEO issues.
    </p>
  </div>

  <ul class="audit-list">
    <li>Unclear service page hierarchy</li>
    <li>Missing or weak local intent signals</li>
    <li>Technical SEO issues confusing search engines</li>
    <li>Pages competing with each other instead of supporting rankings</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- SOLUTION -->
<section>
  <h2>What We Changed</h2>
  <p>
    Based on the audit findings, we rebuilt the foundation carefully.
  </p>

  <p>
    Changes focused on making the website easy to understand —
    both for search engines and real people.
  </p>

  <ul class="audit-list">
    <li>Clear service-based page structure</li>
    <li>Improved internal linking</li>
    <li>Stronger local relevance signals</li>
    <li>Cleaner technical SEO foundation</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- RESULTS -->
<section>
  <h2>The Results</h2>
  <p>
    Over the following months, organic visibility improved steadily.
    The business began receiving more calls without increasing ad spend.
  </p>

  <div style="margin-top:32px;">
    <img src="results-graph.png" alt="Organic growth results" style="width:100%; border-radius:12px;">
    <p style="font-size:0.9rem; opacity:0.7; margin-top:8px;">
      Organic growth after structural and SEO improvements.
    </p>
  </div>

  <ul class="audit-list">
    <li>Consistent month-over-month organic traffic growth</li>
    <li>Improved rankings for high-intent local keywords</li>
    <li>Reduced dependency on Google Ads</li>
    <li>Estimated traffic value equivalent to <strong>$2.8K/month</strong></li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- WHY IT WORKED -->
<section>
  <h2>Why This Worked</h2>
  <p>
    The results were not caused by tricks or automation.
  </p>

  <p>
    They came from aligning the website with how search engines
    and customers actually evaluate trust and clarity.
  </p>

  <ul class="audit-list">
    <li>Clear explanations of services</li>
    <li>Strong structural signals</li>
    <li>Reduced friction for users</li>
    <li>Consistency between real-world quality and online presence</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Could This Work for Your Business?</h2>
  <p>
    Every business is different.
    But clarity always starts with understanding what is really happening.
